** What does it do?

Show event history and command history of some or all buffers.

** What does it look like?

[[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode/raw/master/screenshot1.png]]

** Where is it from?

This package is a fork of [[http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/emacs/mwe-log-commands.el][mwe-log-commands.el]] by Michael Weber <michaelw@foldr.org>

** How is it different?

1. Remove "mwe-" prefix, but keep credits to mwe.
2. Make minor-mode and global minor-mode.
3. Hosted on github so pull requests, etc are easy.
