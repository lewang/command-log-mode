** What it do?

Show event history and command history of some or all buffers.

** What it look like?

[[https://github.com/lewang/command-log-mode/raw/master/screenshot1.png]]

** How do I use it?

   Use the =clm/toggle-command-log-buffer= command.  This use-package
   configuration will configure this command to log globally, including the
   mininbuffer, and to disable the global minor mode when you toggle while the
   buffer is visible.  Customize the =command-log= group for more options.

   #+begin_src elisp

     (use-package command-log-mode
        :custom
        (command-log-mode-window-font-size 20)
        (command-log-mode-open-log-turns-on-mode t "Show buffer enables mode")
        (command-log-mode-close-log-turns-off-mode t "Show buffer disables mode")
        (command-log-mode-is-global "Auto-enable with global minor mode (including minibuffer)")
        :config

        ;; Be chatty.  Show everything besides self-insert-command
        (setq clm/log-command-exceptions* '(self-insert-command)))

   #+end_src

** Where it from?

This package is a fork of [[http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/emacs/mwe-log-commands.el][mwe-log-commands.el]] by Michael Weber <michaelw@foldr.org>

** How it different?

1. Remove "mwe-" prefix, but keep credits to mwe.
2. Make minor-mode and global minor-mode.
3. Hosted on github so pull requests, etc are easy.
